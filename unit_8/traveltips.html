		<p> Planning your trip to a different state can be tasking. But you can manage your preparation by getting information on travel documents, best cities to visit, the weather, and things to do. It’s important to pick the best season of the year for the activities you hope to engage in.</p>
		
		<p> Summer and spring are perfect for visiting parks and camping, sightseeing, and hiking, while fall allows you enjoy nature at its most colorful. If you hope to ski and snowboard, winter should be your preferred travel time.</p>

		<p>First-time travelers from other states can expect to experience a range of weather in Colorado. You can go from wearing shorts and a t-shirt to long pants, jacket and hat, within only a few hours, or just a change in elevation. The higher altitude here compared to the lower elevation in most other states may cause altitude sickness accompanied by nausea and headaches.</p>

		<p>With an average height of 6,801 feet, or 2,073 meters, this state is probably best enjoyed by staying in Denver first, for at least a night or two. Why? The intermediate elevation of 5,280 feet, in this world-class city allows travelers from other U.S. states to find a balance before hiking in the mountains. You definitely need to acclimate before exploring up into the 14,000+ top peaks.</p>

		<p>As for clothing, since it’s difficult to predict the weather, you may need to pack both thick and light clothes. Morning temperature may require a pullover, but a lighter shirt should do by midday. Afternoon rain and lightning storms are frequent in June and July, so expect cooler temperatures and a rain jacket.</p>

		<p>The items below are good rule of thumb, no matter what time of year, you’ll be doing more than visiting the hotel bar.</p>

		<ul> 
		<li>Hiking boots (you can wear these to dinner…it’s a laid back state)</li>
		<li>Hydration backpack or refillable water bottle</li>
		<li>Lip balm and sunscreen</li>
		<li>Lotation! It is very dry here!</li>
		<li>Extra footwear</li>
		<li>Plenty of layers</li>
		<li>Rain jacket (in case of storms)</li>
		<li>Sunglasses and hat</li>
		<li>Phone/camera</li>
		<li>Whistle/compass if exploring off the beaten path</li>
		</ul>
